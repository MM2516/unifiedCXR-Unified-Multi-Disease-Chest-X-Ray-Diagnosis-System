# unifiedCXR-Unified-Multi-Disease-Chest-X-Ray-Diagnosis-System
A unified, modular deep-learning system for automated detection of multiple thoracic diseases from Chest X-ray images, integrating three independent CNN models into a single web-based diagnostic dashboard with real-time inference and explainable predictions. 

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML system design, from dataset exploration and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.
